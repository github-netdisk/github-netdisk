# JFLS 302 Studio

## Introduction

This organization(studio) was set up mainly by members from a men's dormitory in JFLS, grade 11. We now have 5~8 members, both are active.

Our studio can construct various projects, consisted with but not limited in laser making, carpentry, programming, adventuring, and gaming. Under our teachers' inspirations, we're easily to find good creative and excited thoughts.

These wonderful ideas enriched our recognitions, and we benefited a lot. We believe that we're experiencing the real high school lives. We're setting up the organization(studio), to record our activities and stories, so that one day when we look back, we can find our past, and that moments' emotions. That's the very point permanently.
